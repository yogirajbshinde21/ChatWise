Purpose: Holds utility files and shared code used across your backend.

Common files:

cloudinary.js: Handles image uploads to Cloudinary.

db.js: Manages database connection setup.

utils.js: Helper functions (like generating tokens).

Think of it as: A toolbox for your backend—reusable code that doesn’t fit elsewhere.
